## ReFFlex-GCN

The implementation of *Tackling Over-squashing in GNNs via Probabilistic Curvature Measurement on Random Walks*

## Evaluation

To train and evaluate the model on node classification tasks, run:

```node classification
python run_node_classification.py --rewiring ReFFlex
```

To train and evaluate the model on graph classification tasks, run:
```graph classification
python run_graph_classification.py --rewiring ReFFlex
```
